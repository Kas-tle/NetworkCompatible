Support is only maintained for the latest version of the library published to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/dev.kastle.netty/netty-transport-raknet).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be reported privately through the [security tab](https://github.com/Kas-tle/NetworkCompatible/security) of the repository. For detailed instructions on this process, see these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) from GitHub.

After the vulnerability is reported, it will be reviewed as soon as practicable. If a fix is required, a fix will be developed and released as soon as possible. The reporter of the vulnerability will be kept informed of the progress until the vulnerability is resolved.

Once the vulnerability is fixed, the maintainer and reporter will mutually agree on a timeline for publicly disclosing full details of the vulnerability.
