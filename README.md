# NetworkCompatible

## Introduction

You can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/5z4GuSnqmQ) for help with this fork. This is a fork of [CloudburstMC/Network](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Network) with a focus on improving the compatibility of the client side of the library to more closely align with the vanilla Minecraft Bedrock client.

## Changes from Original Library

- New incoming connection batches additional packets to more closely imitate the vanilla client:
  - A `Connected Ping`
  - The first game packet, `Request Network Settings Packet`
- Allows for resetting security state if `Open Connection Reply 1` is resent by the server
- Only do retries with `Open Connection Request 1`, and reserve `Open Connection Request 2` only as a direct response to `Open Connection Reply 1`
- Allows using datagram channel factories for raknet (from [@AlexProgrammerDE](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE))
